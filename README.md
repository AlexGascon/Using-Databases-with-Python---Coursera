#Introduction
This repository contains the resources and materials I've generated myself during the course ["Using Databases with Python"](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-databases/), from University of Michigan and offered in Coursera. This course is one of the best Python courses offered in Coursera.

#Content available
Currently, the only content available are the Python files corresponding to the programming assignments I've coded for the course. I plan on making available also documents with my notes from the course, but I'm still finishing them

#Folder structure
The content follows the same structure than the course: there's a folder for each of the weeks the course is structured in, and them contains all the material from that week. There are two types of files: the ones that start with "C" are the coding files containing the exercises, while the ones that start with "A" are other resources used on or obtained as a result from the assignments. The other two numbers represent the unit and the index of that document within the type+week respectively.

*Example: the file starting with C4.2. is the 2nd coding file needed for the programming assignment used on Unit 4*
